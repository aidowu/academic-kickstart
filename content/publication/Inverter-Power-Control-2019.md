abstract: The electrical grid is evolving from a network consist- ing of mostly synchronous machines to a mixture of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources such as wind, solar, and energy storage. This transformation has led to a decrease in mechanical inertia, which necessitate a need for the new resources to provide frequency responses by controlling their inverter interfaces. In this paper we proposed a new strategy based on model predictive control to determine the the optimal active- power set-point for inverters in the event of a disturbance in the system. In contrast to existing methods, our framework explicitly takes the hard constraints in power and energy into account. We show that it is also robust to measurement noise and limited communications by using an observer to estimate the model mismatches in real-time. We demonstrate that our proposed controller significantly outperforms an optimally tuned virtual synchronous machine on standard IEEE 9-bus and 39- bus systems under a number of scenarios. In turn, this implies optimized inverter-based resources can provide better frequency responses compared to conventional synchronous machines.
