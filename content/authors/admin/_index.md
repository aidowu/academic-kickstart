I am a fifth year PhD candidate advised by [Prof. Baosen Zhang](http://zhangbaosen.github.io) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle. My broad research interests are in control and optimization of complex dynamic systems.  My doctoral thesis focuses on data-driven optimal control of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for frequency control in a low-inertia power network, that is, a power systems with a high penetration of renewable energy.
